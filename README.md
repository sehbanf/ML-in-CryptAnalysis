# ML-in-CryptAnalysis
Decrypting cipher text using Machine Learning Paradigm <br />
This repository contains the source code for a crypt-analysis project for both English and Spanish languages. The code for the English language can be found in the file named [main.ipynb](main.ipynb), while the source code for the Spanish language can be found in [main-Spanish.ipynb](main-Spanish.ipynb). <br />

To facilitate the analysis, the text corpora for both languages are provided in the [Dataset](Dataset) folder. These corpora serve as the basis for the analysis and will be used as the input for the code. <br />

For those interested in a more detailed explanation of the project, a comprehensive report has been included in the file named [Group_6.pdf](Group_6.pdf). This document covers the background, methodology, results and conclusions of the project in greater detail. <br />
Results, as well as any relevant flowcharts, can be found in the [Images](Images) folder. </br>
This repository can be used for educational purposes and as a reference for individuals interested in crypt-analysis. <br />
